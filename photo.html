      Hi! I'm Nat. This is my portfolio with some representative projects I've done so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an architect, my biggest concern is how to make space a regenerative place for society.
      I am passionately interested in space and of what happens in it, and I am also passionately
      interested in social phenomena. I believe that architecture has to be with the way we
      understand the world and how we reflect it, how we scale it to make it ours.
      With experience in social development, planning and design I am looking to rethink our
      cities in order to create more inclusive and harmonious places to live in.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an amateur photographer, my job is to be the architect of the images: to build them
      from what they already are and to share with the inhabitant my vision from this bit of
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please, feel free to contact me. I truly believe that collaboration is the first step to make
      things possible. I will be very glad hearing from you.
